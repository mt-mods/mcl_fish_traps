# Fishing Traps for MCL2/A
Kinda a rewrite, kinda an improvement, kinda what I needed.  
Adapted to be less op and easier on servers, I hope.  
Prone to more changes as I figure stuff out.  
Minetest >= 5.7.0 is required.
  
Don't bug mt-mods for issues with this fork.  

Original mod and desc:  
https://github.com/mt-mods/mcl_fish_traps  
Adds fishing traps to MineClone 2. Just place in the water, and it will automatically and slowly fish for you. Has the same loot table as the fishing rod. The trap must be surrounded horizontally by (river) water source blocks.

## Compatibility
Both MCL2/VoxeLibre and MCLA should work, not extensively tested.
